System Description:
Buddy Cart is a mobile application designed to connect individuals in need of grocery deliveries with nearby volunteers (referred to as buddy shoppers).

The app simulates four  major tasks that represent the core flow of the user journey, each implemented with a functional vertical prototype. These tasks were identified and refined through earlier design phases and are described below.
